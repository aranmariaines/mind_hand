* Excel

Data from a stationery store is provided: List of items sold by day and region.

Interesting insights I found analyzing this data:
- The region with top sells is East. 
- Sells are going down
- Total items sold in this period: 280

Open the Excel file to find the pivot tables and graphs I used to get the insights
